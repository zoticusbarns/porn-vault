# Getting started

> These are instructions for running an executable. For Docker, [see the dedicated guide](docker)

1. Install and run Elasticsearch ([Installation guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html)). Using a single node is fine.
2. Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/porn-vault/porn-vault/releases) page and download the latest version, for the platform of your choice
3. Unzip the file
4. Open the terminal (CMD for Windows) of your choice, navigate to unzipped folder run the executable `./porn-vault(.exe)` and follow the on-screen instructions
5. Once your app is setup you can visit it on `http://localhost:3000` (or your LAN IP equivalent) in your web browser of choice

> When running in terminal you **MUST** be in the same directory as the executable.  
> Examples:
>
> - `./path/to/vault/porn-vault.exe` will not work
> - `cd ./path/to/vault`, `porn-vault.exe` will work
